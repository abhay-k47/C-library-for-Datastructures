# C-library-for-Datastructures
This repository contains a dynamic C Library with implementation of Linked List, Stack, Queue, Heap, and UnionFind Datastructures. It also contains a static library for Graph Datastructures and basic algorithms like BFS, DFS, kruskal's algorithm for MST.  

Both the libraries can be installed by a makefile script available in the same directory.  

Command: $ make -f file_name  
  
Note: for installing graph library, you should first install datastructures library.
